## Sensitivity

There was also no interaction between the two variables, F(1, 1,287) = 0.28, p = .597, Î·2 < .001, 95% CI [<.001, .005]. However, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2020), we determined our observed power to detect an interaction to be .08. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution.


```{r}
# Define the parameters
alpha <- 0.05        # Significance level
power <- 0.8         # Desired power

# Perform the sensitivity analysis
saved <- pwr.f2.test(u = 1,
            v = 1287,
            f2 = NULL, 
            sig.level = alpha,
            power = power)

saved$f2 # f2 convert to eta squared

saved$f2 / (1 + saved$f2)
```

```{r}
# Perform the sensitivity analysis
saved <- pwr.f2.test(u = 1,
            v = 505,
            f2 = NULL, 
            sig.level = alpha,
            power = power)

saved$f2 # f2 convert to eta squared

saved$f2 / (1 + saved$f2)
```
